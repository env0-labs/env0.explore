## Notes from the Field: The Origin of *Learning in Reverse*

The ideas behind *Learning in Reverse* didn’t emerge from academic theory or an isolated think tank. They came from years of teaching and facilitating learning in environments where I didn’t have the luxury of being an expert. My role was often to take complex, technical material — things I wasn’t necessarily trained in and make it understandable to others, all while under time pressure and with limited resources. 

I wasn’t *teaching* in the traditional sense. I was more of a translator, processing raw information, pulling out the key points, and presenting them in ways that would make sense to the learners. I didn’t have the depth of technical knowledge the engineers did, nor the credentials to back me up but I had the ability to make complex things feel coherent enough to teach. 

This experience showed me how much of learning is about **coherence** and **perceived trust** rather than **absolute correctness**. It also highlighted how much of the learning process is about **sifting through ambiguity**, making sense of partial information, correcting errors as you go, and being comfortable with not having everything perfect from the start.

*Learning in Reverse* came out of this lived experience and while it's not an academic theory, it's a model based on what I’ve seen learners actually do when faced with knowledge that can’t be trusted outright. The learners, like me, had to develop their own ways of figuring out what’s useful, what’s real and what to ignore.
