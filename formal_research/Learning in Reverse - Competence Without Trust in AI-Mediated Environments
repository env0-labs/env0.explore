# Learning in Reverse: Competence Without Trust in AI-Mediated Environments

In increasingly AI-mediated learning environments, traditional instructional models built on trusted expertise, structured curricula, and validated knowledge are becoming less reliable. Learners are often required to build competence in conditions where sources may be unverified, feedback is inconsistent, and the boundary between signal and noise is ambiguous. This paper introduces *Learning in Reverse*, a practitioner-developed conceptual model for navigating learning under epistemic instability.

While AI is often framed as a disruptor of traditional learning models, it does not introduce fundamentally new challenges. Humans have always had to navigate unreliable information and ambiguous sources. What AI does uniquely is foreground the instability. It produces outputs that can exhibit both competence and incompetence in the same sentence. Unlike human teachers, whose trustworthiness can often be inferred from consistency, depth, or context, AI systems lack stable epistemic identity. They do not know when they are right, nor when they are wrong. As a result, learners cannot rely on trust by proxy and must develop their own methods of validation.

The *Learning in Reverse* model identifies three learner behaviours that emerge in this context:  
1. **Reflexive validation**, or the active assessment of a sourceâ€™s trustworthiness  
2. **Authenticity as a filtering mechanism**, in which perceived coherence or usefulness outweighs formal correctness  
3. **Emergent competence**, the development of usable skill through iteration rather than certainty

Rather than attempting to validate the model in full, this paper proposes it as a descriptive framework to explore real-world learning practices in uncertain or AI-assisted environments. It offers a foundation for future empirical study and invites further refinement of the role of trust, validation, and learner agency in modern knowledge construction.
