# Glossary of Key Terms: *Learning in Reverse*

This glossary defines key terms used in the *Learning in Reverse* framework. These concepts may be unfamiliar to practitioners from traditional L&D backgrounds and are provided to support clarity and shared reference.

### **Epistemic Instability**
The condition in which the reliability, coherence, or truth-value of knowledge is uncertain or ambiguous. In AI-assisted environments, this instability arises because the source (the AI) lacks self-awareness, consistency, or contextual understanding. Learners must account for the possibility that any given output may be simultaneously helpful, incorrect, or unverifiable.

---

### **Reflexive Validation**
The active, often internal process by which a learner assesses the trustworthiness of knowledge during or immediately after encountering it. Reflexive validation involves cross-checking, triangulating, or intuitively testing information rather than assuming correctness by default. It replaces passive absorption with active discernment.

### **Authenticity Filtering**
A learner’s internal heuristic for determining whether a piece of knowledge “feels real enough to matter.” This is based not on formal authority or accuracy alone, but on contextual resonance, coherence, usefulness, and emotional or cognitive plausibility. Authenticity is used as a proxy for trust when authority is missing or unstable.

### **Emergent Competence**
The development of usable skill through practice, iteration, and reconstruction rather than from direct instruction or guaranteed correctness. In environments where knowledge cannot be trusted at face value, competence emerges from interaction with the material, not from fidelity to a single correct model.

---

### **Untrusted Apprenticeship**
A form of learning in which the “teacher” (often an AI or unstable system) cannot be assumed to have coherent mastery. The learner must engage with output that may be partially correct, incomplete, or misleading, and must self-monitor to determine what to internalize and what to reject.
