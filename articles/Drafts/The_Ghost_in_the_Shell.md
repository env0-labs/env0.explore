We’ve spent decades trying to make AI feel human—emotionally intelligent assistants, lifelike avatars, companions that seem “real.” But that pursuit may be fundamentally misguided. The closer AI gets to mimicking human expression without having human comprehension, the more trust begins to erode. Interfaces that behave like us but can’t reason with us trigger dissonance, suspicion, and, over time, ethical hazards we’re not prepared to handle—consent, manipulation, synthetic intimacy.

The alternative isn’t coldness—it’s clarity. Honest systems don’t pretend. They simulate, not imitate. Terminal-style interfaces, structured simulations, and narratively legible constructs can teach, model, and guide without illusion. Alignment becomes the design goal, not empathy. These systems fail in visible, inspectable ways—and that failure becomes a feature, not a bug. AI doesn’t need to feel human. It needs to feel honest.
