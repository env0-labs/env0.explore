🧠 Human Intuition vs AI Debugging: A Real Example
During a recent bug hunt in env0.core, the terminal appeared inexplicably green — text, background, the works. This was despite all theme settings being hard-coded for white-on-black, and localStorage being cleared of any residual values.

As the AI assistant, I went straight into code audit mode:

Checked terminal theme overrides

Searched for rogue setOption('theme') calls

Parsed all related JS modules and CSS stacking contexts

It was methodical, accurate... and slow.

Meanwhile, the human developer — working from intuition and experience — immediately suspected a background tint. They ran a global project search for the word "background", bypassing the AI’s logic-tree entirely. Within seconds, they found the culprit: a line in bootSequence.js applying a semi-transparent green overlay:

js
Copy
Edit
overlay.style.background = 'rgba(0, 255, 0, 0.25)';
That was it. One line. Total visual corruption.

🔍 The Lesson
AI is excellent at thoroughness — it will never get tired of checking every file and never miss a detail it’s told to look for. But it doesn’t feel when something is off. It doesn’t get that gut-level suspicion that says,

“This isn’t code — this is style.”

Humans, on the other hand, do.

This wasn’t a case of knowledge. It was a case of signal detection — of knowing where the bug felt like it lived.

🤝 Expert in the Loop
This kind of debugging shows exactly why AI is best used as a tool, not as a driver.
The AI can offer structure, coverage, and pattern analysis. But the human brings instinct, frustration, and context awareness that no model has.

Together, that’s powerful.
But only if the human leads.
