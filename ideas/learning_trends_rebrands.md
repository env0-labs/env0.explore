# Learning Trends: Old Ideas, New Wrapping  
*A plainspoken comparison of modern learning trends and their historical roots.*

| Modern Concept                | Original Concept / Era               | Origin Year | Key Figures                          | What’s Actually New (if anything)                                |

| **Personalized Learning**    | Adaptive Instruction                 | ~1960s–90s  | B.F. Skinner, M. Gordon               | Algorithmic scale, richer data—goal still individual alignment   |
| **Learning Agility**         | Metacognition                        | ~1979–90s   | John Flavell                         | Repackaged reflection and transfer skills                        |
| **Stretch Assignments**      | Zone of Proximal Development         | 1978        | Lev Vygotsky                         | Manager-led application of old theory                            |
| **Learning Experience Design** | Instructional Design (ADDIE etc.)  | ~1975–80s   | Robert Gagné, US military training   | UX design layered over traditional ID frameworks                 |
| **Learning Ecosystem**       | LMS + Knowledge Management           | ~1990s      | Peter Senge, KM pioneers             | Better integration, more tools, same architecture                |
| **AI Copilots / Tutors**     | Cognitive Apprenticeship             | 1991        | Allan Collins, John Seely Brown      | Scaffolding delivered by probabilistic models instead of humans  |
| **Knowledge Retention Tools**| Spaced Repetition                    | 1973        | Sebastian Leitner                    | More interactivity and gamification, core method unchanged       |
| **Competency Mapping**       | Bloom’s/Krathwohl’s Taxonomy         | 1956 / 2001 | Benjamin Bloom, Lorin Anderson       | More visual, more granular, but structurally the same            |
| **Goal-Based Scenarios**     | Goal-Based Learning                  | 1990s       | Roger Schank                         | Digital simulation replaces paper scenario                       |
| **Situated Cognition**       | Situated Learning Theory             | ~1980s      | Jean Lave, John Dewey (indirectly)   | Now marketed as real-world task alignment                        |
| **Performance Support Tools**| Job Aids / Electronic Perf. Support  | ~1980s–90s  | Gloria Gery                          | Delivered inside apps, context-aware                             |
| **Learning Styles**          | Pseudoscientific Typologies          | ~1970s–80s  | Neil Fleming, David Kolb, others     | None. Should be quietly buried. Never worked. Still doing harm.  |
| **MBTI in L&D**              | Jungian Typology Repackaged          | 1944        | Isabel Briggs Myers, Katharine Cook Briggs | None. Put it in the same dumpster as Learning Styles. Burn it.   |

> **Note:**  
> Despite widespread popularity, both Learning Styles and MBTI have been extensively critiqued and largely discredited in academic research. Their continued use reflects cultural inertia, not evidence-based practice.
