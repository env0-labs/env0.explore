# Learning Trends: Old Ideas, New Wrapping  
*A plainspoken comparison of modern learning trends and their historical roots.*

| Modern Concept                | Original Concept / Era           | What’s Actually New (if anything)                                |
|------------------------------|----------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Microlearning**            | Just-in-Time Learning (1990s)    | Mobile delivery, tighter scoping, more media-rich                |
| **Unstructured Learning**    | Informal Learning (1990s)        | Social feeds and AI-curated content, but same informal logic     |
| **Social Learning**          | Communities of Practice          | Tech mediation, but human dynamics remain the same               |
| **Personalized Learning**    | Adaptive Instruction             | Algorithmic scale, richer data—goal still individual alignment   |
| **Learning Agility**         | Metacognition                    | Repackaged reflection and transfer skills                        |
| **Stretch Assignments**      | Zone of Proximal Development     | Manager-led application of old theory                            |
| **Learning Experience Design** | Instructional Design            | UX design layered over traditional ID frameworks                 |
| **Learning Ecosystem**       | LMS + Knowledge Management       | Better integration, more tools, same architecture                |
| **AI Copilots / Tutors**     | Cognitive Apprenticeship         | Scaffolding delivered by probabilistic models instead of humans  |
| **Knowledge Retention Tools**| Spaced Repetition (1970s–90s)    | More interactivity and gamification, core method unchanged       |
| **Competency Mapping**       | Bloom’s/Krathwohl’s Taxonomy     | More visual, more granular, but structurally the same            |
| **Goal-Based Scenarios**     | Roger Schank (1990s)             | Digital simulation replaces paper scenario                       |
| **Situated Cognition**       | 1980s Situated Learning Theory   | Now marketed as real-world task alignment                        |
| **Performance Support Tools**| Job Aids, Reference Guides       | Delivered inside apps, context-aware                             |
| **Learning Styles**          | Persistent Pseudoscience         | None. Should be quietly buried. Never worked. Still doing harm.  |
| **MBTI in L&D**              | Jungian Typology (1940s)         | None. Put it in the same dumpster as Learning Styles. Burn it.   |
