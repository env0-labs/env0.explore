# DASHCAM – Detailed Story Outline (~20 mins)

---

## SCENE 1 – Cereal Thriller Performance (1:00)

**INT. KERRI’S ROOM – NIGHT**

Kerri films the intro to their latest episode with fake brightness.  
Alice is offscreen, watching the live preview on her laptop. Annoyed.

> “Burke and Hare. Again.”  
> “We’re out of stuff, Alice. This still gets clicks.”

They argue:
- Kerri: still a believer in the channel, in mystery
- Alice: burned out, bitter, worried about money

➡ **Transition:** Kerri, quietly scrolling through their video comments, pauses.  
> “What’s this?”

---

## SCENE 2 – The Comment (1:30)

**INT. KERRI’S LAPTOP SCREEN – LATE NIGHT**

Low-res dashcam footage: dark Scottish road, headlights bouncing.  
A shape lurches into frame. Long. Human? Deer? It vanishes into trees.  
No explanation. No description. 9 views.

Posted by **hippyjohn212**. Kerri DMs him.

He replies fast: enthusiastic, personable. Fan of the channel. Says he recognises the road.

> “I grew up near there. I can take you to the spot.”

➡ **Transition:** Smash cut to wheels turning — they’ve gone.

---

## SCENE 3 – Into the Highlands (2:30)

**EXT. HIGHLAND ROAD – EVENING**

Alice drives. GPS shows a blank map with a single line — no side roads, no markers.  
The trees close in. No signal. Light dying. Isolation total.

They pass an old sign: **Invermarven Farm**.  
> “There. That’s what he mentioned.”

➡ **Transition:** Headlights cut through increasing darkness. Trees tighten. The road dips.

---

## SCENE 4 – The Thing in the Road (2:00)

**EXT. SINGLE TRACK ROAD – NIGHT**

The car jolts to a stop. Something is blocking the road — **red, slick, formless**.  
Alice wants to reverse. Kerri insists on filming.

Then: headlights go dark. Automatic shutoff.  
**SNAP.** Close. Branch breaking.

Headlights return.  
**The Mountain Man** stands in front of the shape, dragging it by chain.  
He turns to look directly into the lights. Silent.

Alice throws the car into gear. They tear away down the road.

➡ **Transition:** Interior of the car. Shaken.  
> “We got it.”

---

## SCENE 5 – Upload & Blowup (1:30)

**EXT. PUB CARPARK – LATER**

Alice: “We’re done. No story is worth that.”  
Kerri: uploading a clip.

> **Title:** *We HIT Something… Then It Followed Us*

It posts. View count ticks upward. Comments explode.

Message from John:  
> “You’re not mad. I’ve seen him too. I know where the commune was.”

➡ **Transition:** Kerri slaps the laptop shut.  
Cut to roadside. Waiting.

---

## SCENE 6 – Meeting Hippy John (1:30)

**EXT. LAY-BY – DAY**

John arrives. Late 50s. Messy but kind.

He explains:
- Peaceful protest commune
- Gradual descent into isolation and ritual
- “They started worshipping the idea of something that watched us.”
- “I left. I think he stayed.”

> “There’s not much left. But I can show you.”

➡ **Transition:** He steps into the trees. They follow.

---

## SCENE 7 – The Ruins (2:00)

**EXT. COMMUNE RUINS – DUSK**

Decaying tents. Stone rings. Burned symbols. Effigies.

John tells fragmented stories.  
Then he **disappears**.

> **ALICE**: “John?”

➡ **Transition:** They walk back toward the car. Lights still on.

---

## SCENE 8 – The Tarp Bundle / Car Dies (1:30)

**EXT. ROAD / HEADLIGHT BEAM – NIGHT**

Dashcam frame: a **plastic-wrapped bundle** in the road.

Alice exits to investigate.

She kneels. Pulls the edge of the tarp —  
**Nothing inside.** Just damp lining and grit. Empty.  
Her face tightens. This wasn’t a body. It was *bait*.

**In the dashcam frame:**  
Her shadow stretches forward. In the far edge — **something moves**.  
A vague shape. Still. Watching.

She returns to the car. Tries to start it — nothing.  
Click. Again. Dead.

> **ALICE**: “We sleep here. First light, we walk.”

They lock the doors.

➡ **Transition:** Dashcam idles. Then darkness.

---

## SCENE 9 – The Ambush (2:00)

**INT. INSIDE THE CAR – PRE-DAWN**

They wake. Breath misting.

- **Shoes are gone**
- **Map is missing**
- **Glovebox open**
- **Keys are turned in the ignition**

**Someone was inside the car.**

Alice gets out. Dashcam rolls.

**The Mountain Man appears**, partially in frame. Silent. Watching.

**Everything else is offscreen:**
- Screams
- Movement
- Chain

Alice reappears, dragging Kerri — unconscious, bloody.  
She rips the dashcam card.

➡ **Transition:** Hard cut. Silence.

---

## SCENE 10 – The Edit (1:30)

**INT. FLAT – EARLY MORNING**

Alice edits. Kerri records a talking head — tightly cropped.

Overlay text, pacing, dramatic cuts.  
No hint of injury.

> **Final Title:** *The Cult That Eats People (Scotland’s Secret Road)*

PUBLISH.

➡ **Transition:** Comment section floods. Trending.

---

## SCENE 11 – The Cost (3:00)

**INT. FLAT – DAY**

Kerri sits in front of a laptop.

**Camera pulls back:**
- **Wheelchair**
- One leg casted
- The other **amputated**, under a blanket

No words. They sit in silence.

> **KERRI**: “They think it’s fake.”  
> **ALICE**: “Good.”  
> **KERRI**: “This one cost more.”  
> **ALICE**: “It’ll trend.”

➡ **Transition:** Fan noise. New comment loads:  
> *“Scripted but fun.”*

---

## SCENE 12 – Optional Final Beat (1:00)

**INT. DASHCAM FOOTAGE – REPLAY**

Static frame. Night.

**The Mountain Man walks through frame**.  
Dragging something. Doesn’t look. Doesn’t stop.

**Fade out.**

---

*End.*
