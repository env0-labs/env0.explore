# DASHCAM – Detailed Story Outline (~20 mins)

---

## SCENE 1 – Cereal Thriller Performance (1:00)

**INT. KERRI’S ROOM – NIGHT**

Kerri delivers the intro to their YouTube show, *Cereal Thriller*. Her voice is upbeat, but the energy is forced — she’s performing for the algorithm, not the audience. Offscreen, Alice watches the feed with growing frustration. She pauses the recording.

They argue: Alice thinks the show is dead, the mystery space is saturated, and they're scraping the bottom. Kerri clings to the idea that something real is still out there — something that could save them if they just found the right story.

Alice challenges her to name one.

> **Motivation bridge:**  
> Kerri starts scrolling through video comments not because she expects anything — but because she *needs* there to be something. It's desperation, not optimism, that drives the next click.

---

## SCENE 2 – The Comment (1:30)

**INT. KERRI’S LAPTOP – LATE NIGHT**

A random comment on their last video links to a low-view dashcam clip. In it, a strange shape moves across a Highland road at night. It’s barely visible. Kerri plays it again, frame by frame.

She shows Alice, who’s unimpressed — could be a deer, compression artifact, anything. But Kerri’s attention is locked on the shape. It's not what it is, it's *how it moves*. The uncanny gap is enough for her to believe.

She messages the uploader: **hippyjohn212**. He replies instantly — disarmingly kind. Big fan of the channel. Says he knows where it was shot. Offers to take them.

> **Motivation bridge:**  
> Alice isn’t convinced by the footage — she’s convinced by *Kerri’s belief*. Their partnership is fraying, but not broken. Alice agrees to go *not for the mystery, but for Kerri*. If it turns out to be nothing, they'll just drive home.

## SCENE 3 – Into the Highlands (2:30)

**EXT. HIGHLAND ROAD – EVENING**

The car climbs into the wilderness. GPS shows a single road. No signal. No turnoffs. The world starts to vanish outside the headlights. They pass a faded sign: **INVERMARVEN FARM**.

There’s a growing tension. Alice drives in silence. Kerri watches the landscape, phone camera recording details — hopeful, like they’re on a proper shoot again.

They stop. Rewatch the original dashcam video. Frame by frame. The same road. It’s the right place.

> **Motivation bridge:**  
> Just as Alice starts to doubt *again*, they see something. A shape. A bundle. In the real world, in the road, just like the video.

They’re not chasing a mystery anymore. They’ve *entered* it.

## SCENE 4 – The Thing in the Road (2:00)

**EXT. SINGLE TRACK ROAD – NIGHT**  
**[DASHCAM FOOTAGE]**

The car stops dead. Something lies in the beam of the headlights — a dark, red, wet shape. It’s not immediately clear what it is. It doesn’t move.

Alice wants to back up. Kerri starts filming. Before either decides what to do, the headlights go out — auto shutoff. Complete darkness.

A branch snaps. Close. Neither speaks.

The headlights come back on.

**[DASHCAM FOOTAGE]**  
Now in full beam, a man is standing in the road. **Bare-chested, massive**, with a heavy chain across his shoulder. He’s dragging the shape — now clearly a carcass — across the tarmac. He stops. Looks directly into the headlights.

Doesn’t speak. Doesn’t move.

Alice throws the car into gear and drives past him, fast.

> **Motivation bridge:**  
> For the first time, the fear is real. Alice wants to run. Kerri wants to *understand*. But now they both know: this isn’t just spooky video content. It’s dangerous. And they’re in it.

---

## SCENE 5 – Upload & Blowup (1:30)

**EXT. PUB CARPARK – NIGHT**

They pull into the safety of civilisation — a pub, light, sound, signal. Alice is visibly shaken. Kerri is quiet, but already reviewing the dashcam footage. It’s all there.

Alice wants to leave. Go home. Burn the footage. But Kerri, despite her fear, sees the numbers. She edits it. Adds the hook. Uploads it.

> **Title:** *We HIT Something… Then It Followed Us*  
> **Thumbnail:** Still of the Mountain Man mid-step. Blurred. Unmistakably human. Unbelievably large.

Comments start within minutes. One of them stands out — **hippyjohn212**.

> “You’re not crazy. I’ve seen him too. I know where the commune was.”

> **Motivation bridge:**  
> Kerri wants to meet him. Alice doesn’t. But Kerri says it — if they don’t follow this thread, someone else will.  
> And this time, Alice doesn’t say no.

---

## SCENE 6 – Meeting Hippy John (1:30)

**EXT. LAY-BY / EDGE OF FOREST – DAY**

John arrives with a smile. Harmless. Loose clothes. Long hair. Speaks gently. He’s a fan — of their show, of the idea that someone still chases *truth*.

He tells them about the commune:
- It started as a protest camp — anti-war, ecological, spiritual
- It got isolated. Twisted. 
- Over time, belief turned into ritual. Then into fear.

> “I left. Most didn’t. He stayed.”

He gestures into the trees.

> “There’s not much left, but I can show you.”

> **Motivation bridge:**  
> Kerri wants to follow. Alice hesitates — it’s not logical. But John’s kindness disarms her. She agrees — on the condition they don’t stay long.

---

## SCENE 7 – The Ruins (2:00)

**EXT. FOREST INTERIOR – DUSK**

They hike in. The woods thicken. Old paths vanish.  
Eventually, they reach it — the remains of a commune long since abandoned.

- A burned-out trailer
- Rotted tents, overgrown with vines
- Symbols carved into bark
- Stone rings, carefully maintained

John walks them through it like a tour guide — but his stories start to fray. He can’t remember who lived where. He contradicts himself. Names slip.

Then, suddenly, he’s gone.

> **ALICE**: “John?”

No response.

> **Motivation bridge:**  
> It’s getting dark. They’ve seen enough. They head back toward the car — shaken, silent.

---

## SCENE 8 – The Tarp Bundle / Car Dies (1:30)

**EXT. SINGLE TRACK ROAD – NIGHT**

They emerge from the trees, shaken. The forest is silent.  
Their car sits ahead — no lights, no hum, no signal.

Alice unlocks it.  
**Click.** The locks disengage.  
They climb in. Doors shut. Breath fogs the air.

The headlights flare on automatically.  
**[DASHCAM FOOTAGE]** kicks in.

Now visible in the beam:  
a **plastic-wrapped bundle**, centre of the road. Neat. Deliberate.

> **KERRI**: “Was that there before?”

Alice says nothing. Gets out.

**[DASHCAM FOOTAGE]**  
She approaches. Shadow long behind her.

Kneels. Peels back the tarp.  
**Nothing inside.** Just damp lining and grit.

She rises.  
**In her shadow — something shifts.**  
A figure. Still. Watching.

Alice gets back in. Turns the key.  
Nothing. Dead.

> **KERRI** (panicked): “We’re not sleeping here.”  
> **ALICE** (flat): “We don’t have a choice.”

She locks the doors.  

**[DASHCAM FOOTAGE]** lingers.  
The bundle. The trees.  
**Motion.** Barely there.

**Cut to black.**

> **Motivation bridge:**  
> Kerri wanted to run. Alice made the call.  
> And that decision will cost them both more than they realise.

---

## SCENE 11 – The Cost (3:00)

**INT. FLAT – DAY**

Muted daylight spills across a cluttered living space. The buzz of a laptop fan hums under a viral comment feed. The video is blowing up. Thousands of views. Comments pouring in.

> *“Scripted but fun.”*  
> *“Great acting!”*  
> *“These girls are killing it lately.”*

Kerri sits at the desk. Still. Staring at the screen.

**Then we cut wide.**

For the first time, we see the full frame:
- **Kerri is in a wheelchair.**
- One leg is fully casted.
- The other is **gone below the knee** — covered by a folded blanket.

Alice stands nearby, arms crossed, watching the analytics roll in.  
Neither says anything for a long moment.

Finally:

> **KERRI**: “They think it’s fake.”  
> **ALICE** (flat): “Good.”  
> **KERRI**: “This one cost more.”  
> **ALICE**: “It’ll trend.”

They sit in silence.  
Not proud. Not victorious. Just… numb.

> **Motivation bridge:**  
> There isn’t one. This is the wall.  
> They got what they wanted — views, validation, a real story —  
> And now they live with what it cost.  
> The Mountain Man doesn’t need to kill you.  
> **The audience will do it for him.**
